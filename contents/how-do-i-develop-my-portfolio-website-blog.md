My experience about developing my first portfolio website and a blog using NextJS and a headless CMS.

## Motivation

Starting the journey of building my personal portfolio was an exciting adventure, motivated by the eagerness to present my skills and experiences as a Full Stack Developer with over 7 years of extensive expertise. In this blog, I'll guide you through the steps of creating a dynamic portfolio using Next.js and TypeScript, shedding light on the technologies that shape my career.

Lately, I've been inclined towards developing my own projects, emphasizing quality over quantity. Once a project is completed, I typically include a comprehensive readme file in the Github repository. However, I find that Github repo readmes are more suitable for technical aspects only (just my perspective). I aspire to document my experiences and challenges, and that's why I've chosen to create my own blog. Moreover, with my current level of experience and confidence, I feel well-equipped to embark on this project.

## Tech Stack

In the tech world, a developer's portfolio is more than just a collection of projects; it's a representation of skills, creativity, and problem-solving ability. My resume lays the foundation, detailing a career marked by contributions to high-impact projects and successful leadership roles. As a seasoned developer, the decision to use Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS for my portfolio was fueled by a commitment to modern and efficient development practices.

The decision to use [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/ "NextJS Official Website") was driven by its ability to provide a seamless developer experience, optimal performance, and server-side rendering â€“ crucial elements for a standout portfolio. TypeScript, being a language I'm well-versed in, was a natural choice to enhance code quality, catch errors early, and ensure a maintainable codebase.

Styling plays a pivotal role in the user experience. Enter [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/ "Tailwind CSS Official Website") â€“ a utility-first CSS framework. Its simplicity, flexibility, and ease of customization allowed me to create a sleek and responsive design that adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes.

Each section of my portfolio was meticulously crafted to represent various facets of my expertise. From the projects showcase to a blog section for sharing insights, the structure aimed to offer a comprehensive view of my skills, experiences, and continuous learning journey.

Images and assets are uploaded and stored in [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/ "Cloudinary Official Website"). I connect Cloudinary via Forestry and manage them directly in the dashboard.

Throughout the blog, I delve into coding strategies, best practices, and the rationale behind the choices made during the development process. Whether it's improving RESTful APIs or building responsive pages with frameworks like Angular, React.js, and Vue.js, the aim was to share knowledge and inspire fellow developers.

In conclusion, these are the tech stack I've used for this project.

- Front-end: NextJS (TypeScript)
- Styling: TailwindCSS
- Animations: GSAP
- CMS: Forestry Headless CMS
- Deployment: Vercel

## Features

The following are certain features of my portfolio and blog

### SEO Friendly

The entire project is developed with SEO focus in mind. I've used proper meta tags, descriptions and heading alignments. This website is now indexed by Google.

> You can search this website on google by using keywords like 'prometheus dev'

Moreover, this website will be displayed well when shared to social media due to properly used meta tags.

### Dynamic Sitemap

Sitemap plays an important part in SEO. Because of this, every single page of this site should be included in sitemap.xml. I made an auto generated sitemap in my website whenever I create a new content or tags or categories.

### Light & Dark Themes

Due to dark theme trend in recent years, many websites include dark theme out of the box nowadays. Certainly, my website also supports light & dark themes.

### Fully Accessible

This website is fully accessible. You can navigate around by only using keyboard. I put all a11y enhancement best practices like including alt text in all images, no skipping headings, using semantic HTML tags, using aria-attributes properly.

### Search box, Categories & Tags

All blog contents can be searched by search box. Moreover, contents can be filtered by categories and tags. In this way, blog readers can search and read what they really want.

### Animations

Initially I used [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/ "Framer Motion") to add animations and micro interactions for this website. However, when I tried to use some complex animations and parallax effects, I found it inconvenient to integrate with Framer Motion (Maybe I'm not very good at and used to working with it). Hence, I decided to use [GSAP](https://greensock.com/ "GSAP Animation Library") for all of my animations. It is one of the most popular animation library and it is capable of doing complex and advanced animations. You can see animations and micro interactions on pretty much every page of this website.

## Outro

The journey of building my portfolio with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS was a rewarding experience. It not only served as a platform to showcase my skills but also as an opportunity to contribute to the developer community by sharing insights and best practices.

Explore the live portfolio, dive into the code on GitHub, and let's continue this journey of continuous learning and innovation together!

Happy coding! ðŸš€âœ¨
